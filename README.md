# 🏏 T20 World Cup 2024: Data-Driven Team Selection

### 📄 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **T20 World Cup 2024** dataset to identify the best performing Playing XI of the tournament. 
Instead of relying on basic stats like "Total Runs" or "Total Wickets," I built a **Weighted Scoring Model** to select players based on **Impact, Efficiency, and Consistency**.

### 📊 Key Insights & Results
Using Python and Pandas, I processed **11,000+ ball-by-ball records** to engineer advanced metrics.
The final "Data-Driven XI" outperforms the average tournament player by:
* **+40%** in Strike Rate (for Batters)
* **-25%** in Economy Rate (for Bowlers)

#### 🏆 The Selected Best XI
| Role | Player | Key Stat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Opener** | Travis Head (AUS) | SR: 158.4 |
| **Opener** | Rohit Sharma (IND) | Runs: 257 |
| **Wicketkeeper** | Rahmanullah Gurbaz (AFG) | Runs: 281 |
| **Middle Order** | Jos Buttler (ENG) | SR: 158.5 |
| **Middle Order** | Nicholas Pooran (WI) | SR: 146.2 |
| **Middle Order** | Andries Gous (USA) | Avg: 43.8 |
| **Spinner** | Rashid Khan (AFG) | Wkts: 14 |
| **Pacer** | Jasprit Bumrah (IND) | Econ: 4.18 |
| **Pacer** | Fazalhaq Farooqi (AFG) | Wkts: 17 |
| **Pacer** | Arshdeep Singh (IND) | Wkts: 17 |
| **Pacer** | Anrich Nortje (SA) | Wkts: 15 |

### 🧠 Methodology
The analysis followed a 4-step data science pipeline:

1.  **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, standardized names, and filtered for legal deliveries (excluding wides/noballs from ball counts).
2.  **Feature Engineering**:
    * **Batting Impact**: Calculated *Strike Rate* (Runs/Balls * 100) and *Average* (Runs/Outs).
    * **Bowling Efficiency**: Calculated *Economy Rate* (Runs/Overs) and *Bowling Strike Rate* (Balls/Wickets).
3.  **Weighted Scoring Model**:
    * *Batters* = `0.5 * Normalized_Runs` + `0.3 * Normalized_SR` + `0.2 * Normalized_Avg`
    * *Bowlers* = `0.6 * Normalized_Wickets` + `0.4 * (1 - Normalized_Economy)`
4.  **Selection**: Filtered the top-ranked players for specific roles (Openers, Finishers, Pacers, Spinners).
